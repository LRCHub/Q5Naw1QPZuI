[00:47.80] Faster than a cannonball
[00:51.08] Where were you while we were getting high?
[00:56.15] Someday you will find me
[00:59.19] Caught beneath the landslide
[01:03.33] In a champagne supernova in the sky
[01:08.69] Someday you will find me

[02:29.76] That they're gonna get away for the summer
[02:50.76] 
[02:39.51] But you and I, we live and die
[02:42.54] The world's still spinning 'round, we don't know why
[02:48.95] Why, why, why, why?
