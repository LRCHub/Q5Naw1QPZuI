I'm waiting for you, supernova
I'm waiting for you, supernova
Supernova
Supernova
I'm waiting for you, supernova
Supernova
Supernova
Drowning in a haze, and I just want to get in deeper
Purple skies with a million stars, I'm falling ground
These days when I'm losing track of time
These days when I'm burning up inside
These days when I'm lost to search the skies
I'm waiting for your last goodbye
'Cause I'm not over it, not over it
I'm waiting for your last goodbye
The kiss of time
Like thunder screaming out for a flash of lightning
Stars are falling down for God's applause
I'm waiting for the light of your supernova
Your last goodbye
I'm waiting for you, supernova
Supernova
Supernova
I'm waiting for you
When the lights go down
I'm still here, and I'm singing for you
When the lights go down
I can't let the music fade
I dive in deep and soar so high
I blow the ashes to free the sky
On a hill, I'm here to say goodbye
I'm waiting for your last goodbye
'Cause I'm not over it, not over it
I'm waiting for your last goodbye
The kiss of time
Like thunder screaming out for a flash of lightning
Stars are falling down for God's applause
I'm waiting for the light of your supernova
Your last goodbye
I'm waiting for you
As long as I dream, it ain't over, over
I'll bring the chains of gravity
Oh, I long for your fire, yeah, I long for your fire
My heart is lost between the stars
Drowning in a haze, and I just want to get in deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper
I'm waiting for your last goodbye
'Cause I'm not over it, not over it
I'm waiting for your last goodbye
The kiss of time
Like thunder screaming out for a flash of lightning
Stars are falling down for God's applause
I'm waiting for the light of your supernova
Your last goodbye
I'm waiting for you, supernova
I'm waiting for you, supernova
Supernova
Supernova
I'm waiting for you
I'm waiting for you, supernova
Supernova
Supernova
Drowning in a haze, and I just want to get in deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper
